The quickest way to start using conda is to go through the 
30-minute :doc:`getting-started` guide.

The ``conda`` command is the primary interface for managing 
installations of various packages. It can:

* Query and search the Anaconda package index and current 
  Anaconda installation.

* Create new conda environments.

* Install and update packages into existing conda environments.

TIP: You can abbreviate many frequently used command options that 
are preceded by 2 dashes (``--``) to just 1 dash and the first 
letter of the option. So ``--name`` and ``-n`` are the same, and 
``--envs`` and ``-e`` are the same.

For full usage of each command, including abbreviations, see 
:doc:`../commands`. You can see the same information at the 
command line by :doc:`viewing the command-line help 
<tasks/view-command-line-help>`.
