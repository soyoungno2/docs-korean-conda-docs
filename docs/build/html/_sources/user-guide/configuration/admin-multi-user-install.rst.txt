=============================================
Administering a multi-user conda installation
=============================================

By default, conda and all packages it installs, including
Anaconda, are installed locally with a user-specific
configuration. Administrative privileges are not required, and
no upstream files or other users are affected by
the installation.

You can make conda and any number of packages available to a
group of 1 or more users, while preventing these users
from installing unwanted packages with conda:

#. Install conda and the allowed packages, if any, in a
   location that is under administrator control and
   accessible to users.

#. Create a
   :doc:`.condarc system configuration file <use-condarc>` in
   the root directory of the installation. This system-level
   configuration file will override any user-level configuration
   files installed by the user.

Each user accesses the central conda installation, which reads
settings from the user ``.condarc`` configuration file located
in their home directory. The path to the user file is the same
as the root environment prefix displayed by ``conda info``,
as shown in :ref:`admin-inst-user` below. The user
``.condarc`` file is limited by the system ``.condarc`` file.

System configuration settings are commonly used in a
system ``.condarc`` file but may also be used in a
user ``.condarc`` file. All user configuration settings may
also be used in a system ``.condarc`` file.

For information about settings in the ``.condarc`` file,
see :doc:`use-condarc`.


.. _admin-inst:

Example administrator-controlled installation
=============================================

The following example describes how to view the system
configuration file, review the settings, compare it to a user's
configuration file and determine what happens when the user
attempts to access a file from a blocked channel. It then
describes how the user must modify their configuration file to
access the channels allowed by the administrator.


System configuration file
---------------------------

#. The system configuration file must be in the top-level conda
   installation directory. Check the path where conda is located:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ which conda
      /tmp/miniconda/bin/conda

#. View the contents of the ``.condarc`` file in the
   administrator's directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cat /tmp/miniconda/.condarc

   The following administrative ``.condarc`` file
   sets ``allow_other_channels`` to ``False``, and it specifies
   that users may download packages only from the ``admin``
   channel:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ cat /tmp/miniconda/.condarc
     allow_other_channels : false
     channel_alias: https://conda.anaconda.org/
     channels:
       - admin

   NOTE: The admin channel can also be expressed as
   https://conda.anaconda.org/admin/

   Because ``allow_other_channels`` is ``False`` and the
   channel defaults are not explicitly specified, users are
   disallowed from downloading packages from the default
   channels. You can check this in the next procedure.

.. _admin-inst-user:

User configuration file
-------------------------

#. Check the location of the user's conda installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ conda info
     Current conda install:
     . . .
            channel URLs : http://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/
                           http://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/pro/osx-64/
            config file : /Users/gergely/.condarc

   The ``conda info`` command shows that conda is using the
   user's ``.condarc file``, located at
   ``/Users/gergely/.condarc`` and that the default channels
   such as ``repo.continuum.io`` are listed as channel URLs.

#. View the contents of the administrative ``.condarc`` file in
   the directory that was located in step 1:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ cat ~/.condarc
     channels:
       - defaults

   This user's ``.condarc`` file specifies only the default
   channels, but the administrator config file has blocked
   default channels by specifying that only ``admin`` is
   allowed. If this user attempts to search for a package in the
   default channels, they get a message telling them what
   channels are allowed:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ conda search flask
      Fetching package metadata:
      Error: URL 'http://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/pro/osx-64/' not
      in allowed channels.
      Allowed channels are:
       - https://conda.anaconda.org/admin/osx-64/

   This error message tells the user to add the ``admin`` channel
   to their configuration file.

#. The user must edit their local ``.condarc`` configuration file
   to access the package through the admin channel:

   .. code-block:: yaml

     channels:
       - admin

   The user can now search for packages in the allowed
   ``admin`` channel.
