Creating custom channels
========================

Channels are the path that conda takes to look for packages. The 
easiest way to use and manage custom channels is to use a private 
or public repository on `Anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org/>`_, 
formerly known as Binstar.org. If you designate your Anaconda.org 
repository as private, then only you and those you grant access 
can access your private repository. 

If you do not wish to upload your packages to the Internet, you 
can build a custom repository served either through a web server 
or locally using a ``file://`` URL.  

To create a custom channel:

#. If you have not yet used conda build, install conda build:

   .. code::

      conda install conda-build

#. Organize all the packages in subdirectories for the platforms 
   you wish to serve:

   .. code::

      channel/
     linux-64/
      package-1.0-0.tar.bz2
     linux-32/
      package-1.0-0.tar.bz2
     osx-64/
      package-1.0-0.tar.bz2
     win-64/
      package-1.0-0.tar.bz2
     win-32/
      package-1.0-0.tar.bz2

#. Run ``conda index`` on each of the platform subdirectories:

   .. code::

      conda index channel/linux-64 channel/osx-64

   The conda index command generates a file ``repodata.json``, 
   saved to each repository directory, which conda uses to get 
   the metadata for the packages in the channel. 

   NOTE: Each time you add or modify a package in the channel, 
   you must rerun ``conda index`` for conda to see the update.

#. To test custom channels, serve the custom channel using a web 
   server or using a ``file:// url`` to the channel directory. 
   Test by sending a search command to the custom channel.

   EXAMPLE: If you want a file in the custom channel location 
   ``/opt/channel/linux-64/``, search for files in that location:
  
   .. code::

      conda search -c file://opt/channel/ --override-channels

   NOTE: The channel URL does not include the platform, as conda 
   automatically detects and adds the platform. 

   NOTE: The option  ``--override-channels`` ensures that conda 
   searches only your specified channel and no other channels, 
   such as default channels or any other channels you may have 
   listed in your ``.condarc`` file.

   If you have set up your private repository correctly, you 
   get the following output:

   .. code::

      Fetching package metadata: . . . .

   This is followed by a list of the conda packages found. This 
   verifies that you have set up and indexed your private 
   repository successfully.
