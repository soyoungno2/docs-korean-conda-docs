Join the conda email group
===========================

Join the mailing lists for both `Anaconda
<https://groups.google.com/a/anaconda.com/forum/#!forum/anaconda>`_
and `conda
<https://groups.google.com/a/anaconda.com/forum/#!forum/conda>`_.
Ask questions, answer questions, discuss ways to use conda,
request new features and submit any other comments you may have.


Contribute recipes to GitHub
===============================

Submit new recipes to the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes. Building recipes is
described in :doc:`user-guide/tasks/build-packages/index`.
When you build a new conda recipe for a program not yet listed in
the repository, use a GitHub pull request to submit it to the
repository, so that others using that program in the future can
reuse it. Recipes are welcome for programs that use any license,
such as GPL, BSD, MIT or Apache, and all of the recipes in this
repository are released into the public domain.


Report bugs
==============

Issues with conda are tracked on GitHub at
https://github.com/conda/conda/issues, and issues with conda
build are tracked at https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues.
If you find a bug, search to see if it has already been reported,
and then report it if no one else has.


Send feedback
=============

Send feedback about the conda documentation to
`documentation@anaconda.com <mailto:documentation@anaconda.com>`_.

Conda announcements list
========================

Conda Announcements is a low-traffic email list for news and
updates directly from the conda core team. It is not a marketing
list. We never sell, give away or distribute your email address
to third parties.

* No more than 1 email per week, usually less.
* Project announcements relevant to all conda users.
* No corporate marketing hype.
* No spam.

For convenience, we use MailChimp to manage subscriptions,
including `archived announcements
<http://us13.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=28f85eefa68de727efcbd93f9&id=cb4ca49e7d>`_.
