RECIPE_PATH
.PP
Tool for building conda packages. A conda package is a binary tarball
containing system\-level libraries, Python modules, executable programs, or
other components. conda keeps track of dependencies between packages and
platform specifics, making it simple to create working environments from
.IP
different sets of packages.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
RECIPE_PATH
Path to recipe directory.
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show the conda\-build version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-source\fR
When templating can't be completed, do not obtain the
source to try fill in related template variables.
.TP
\fB\-\-output\fR
Output the conda package filename which would have
been created
.TP
\fB\-\-python\fR PYTHON
Set the Python version used by conda build.
.TP
\fB\-\-perl\fR PERL
Set the Perl version used by conda build.
.TP
\fB\-\-numpy\fR NUMPY
Set the NumPy version used by conda build.
.TP
\fB\-\-R\fR R_BASE
Set the R version used by conda build.
.TP
\fB\-\-lua\fR LUA
Set the Lua version used by conda build.
.TP
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR BOOTSTRAP
Provide initial configuration in addition to recipe.
Can be a path to or name of an environment, which will
be emulated in the package.
.TP
\fB\-\-append\-file\fR APPEND_SECTIONS_FILE
Append data in meta.yaml with fields from this file.
Jinja2 is not done on appended fields
.TP
\fB\-\-clobber\-file\fR CLOBBER_SECTIONS_FILE
Clobber data in meta.yaml with fields from this file.
Jinja2 is not done on clobbered fields.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR VARIANT_CONFIG_FILES, \fB\-\-variant\-config\-files\fR VARIANT_CONFIG_FILES
Additional variant config files to add. These yaml
files can contain keys such as `c_compiler` and
`target_platform` to form a build matrix.
.TP
\fB\-\-old\-build\-string\fR
Disable hash additions to filenames to distinguish
package variants from one another. NOTE: any filename
collisions are yours to handle. Any variants with
overlapping names within a build will clobber each
other.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR CHANNEL, \fB\-\-channel\fR CHANNEL
Additional channel to search for packages. These are
URLs searched in the order they are given (including
file:// for local directories). Then, the defaults or
channels from .condarc are searched (unless
\fB\-\-override\-channels\fR is given). You can use 'defaults'
to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to
get the system packages, which also takes .condarc
into account. You can also use any name and the
\&.condarc channel_alias value will be prepended. The
default channel_alias is http://conda.anaconda.org/.
.TP
\fB\-\-override\-channels\fR
Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires
\fB\-\-channel\fR.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR FILE, \fB\-\-file\fR FILE
write YAML to file, given as argument here. Overwrites
existing files.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Enable verbose output from download tools and progress
updates
