{linkages,objects,channels,prefix\-lengths,hash\-inputs}
.TP
linkages
Investigates linkages of binary libraries in a package
(works in Linux and OS X). This is an advanced command
to aid building packages that link against C
libraries. Aggregates the output of ldd (on Linux) and

finding broken links, or links against system
libraries that ought to be dependent conda packages.

works on OS X). This is an advanced command to aid
building packages that have compiled libraries.
Aggregates the output of otool on all the binary
object files in a package.
