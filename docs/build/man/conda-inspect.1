.SH OPTIONS

.IP
{linkages,objects,channels,prefix\-lengths,hash\-inputs}
.TP
linkages
Investigates linkages of binary libraries in a package
(works in Linux and OS X). This is an advanced command
to aid building packages that link against C
libraries. Aggregates the output of ldd (on Linux) and
otool \fB\-L\fR (on OS X) by dependent packages. Useful for
finding broken links, or links against system
libraries that ought to be dependent conda packages.
.TP
objects
Investigate binary object files in a package (only
works on OS X). This is an advanced command to aid
building packages that have compiled libraries.
Aggregates the output of otool on all the binary
object files in a package.
.TP
channels
Tools for investigating conda channels.
.TP
prefix\-lengths
Inspect packages in given path, finding those with
binary prefixes shorter than specified
.TP
hash\-inputs
Show data used to compute hash identifier (h????) for
package
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
