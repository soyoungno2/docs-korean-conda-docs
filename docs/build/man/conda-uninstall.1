.SH OPTIONS
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
package_name
Package names to uninstall from the environment.
.SS "optional arguments:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-yes\fR
Do not ask for confirmation.
.TP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Only display what would have been done.
.TP
\fB\-\-json\fR
Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda
programmatically.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Show debug output.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR, \fB\-v\fR
Use once for info, twice for debug, three times for
trace.
.TP
\fB\-\-all\fR
Uninstall all packages, i.e., the entire environment.
.TP
\fB\-\-features\fR
Uninstall features (instead of packages).
.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR
Forces removal of a package without removing packages
that depend on it. Using this option will usually
leave your environment in a broken and inconsistent
state.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-pin\fR
Ignore pinned file.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR CHANNEL, \fB\-\-channel\fR CHANNEL
Additional channel to search for packages. These are
URLs searched in the order they are given (including
file:// for local directories). Then, the defaults or
channels from .condarc are searched (unless
\fB\-\-override\-channels\fR is given). You can use 'defaults'
to get the default packages for conda, and 'system' to
get the system packages, which also takes .condarc
into account. You can also use any name and the
\&.condarc channel_alias value will be prepended. The
default channel_alias is http://conda.anaconda.org/.
.TP
\fB\-\-override\-channels\fR
Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires
\fB\-\-channel\fR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR ENVIRONMENT, \fB\-\-name\fR ENVIRONMENT
Name of environment (in root prefix/envs:/
Users/joelkim/.conda/envs).
.TP
\fB\-p\fR PATH, \fB\-\-prefix\fR PATH
Full path to environment prefix (default:
\fI\,root prefix/envs/conda\-docs\/\fP).
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Do not display progress bar.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-use\-index\-cache\fR
Force fetching of channel index files.
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-index\-cache\fR
Use cache of channel index files.
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-local\fR
Use locally built packages.
.TP
\fB\-\-offline\fR
Offline mode, don't connect to the Internet.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-insecure\fR
Allow conda to perform "insecure" SSL connections and
transfers.Equivalent to setting 'ssl_verify' to
\&'false'.
