.PP
Investigates linkages of binary libraries in a package (works in Linux and
OS X). This is an advanced command to aid building packages that link against
C libraries. Aggregates the output of ldd (on Linux) and otool \fB\-L\fR (on OS X) by
dependent packages. Useful for finding broken links, or links against system
libraries that ought to be dependent conda packages.
