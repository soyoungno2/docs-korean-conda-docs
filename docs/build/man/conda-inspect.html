              {linkages,objects,channels,prefix-lengths,hash-inputs}

       linkages
              Investigates linkages of binary libraries in a package (works in
              Linux and OS X). This is an advanced  command  to  aid  building
              packages that link against C libraries. Aggregates the output of
              ldd (on Linux) and otool <B>-L</B> (on OS  X)  by  dependent  packages.
              Useful  for  finding  broken  links,  or  links  against  system
              libraries that ought to be dependent conda packages.

       objects
              Investigate binary object files in a package (only works  on  OS
              X).  This  is  an advanced command to aid building packages that
              have compiled libraries.  Aggregates the output of otool on  all
              the binary object files in a package.

       channels
              Tools for investigating conda channels.

       prefix-lengths
              Inspect  packages  in given path, finding those with binary pre-
              fixes shorter than specified

       hash-inputs
              Show data used to compute hash identifier (h????) for package
